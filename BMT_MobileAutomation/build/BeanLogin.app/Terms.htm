        <b class="sub-menu-title">Claims Resolution</b>
        <hr>
        <p>Most customer concerns can be resolved by calling our customer service department at the number listed on our website. In the event that customer service is unable to resolve a complaint to your satisfaction, you and we agree to resolve your complaint through binding arbitration instead of courts of general jurisdiction.
        <br><br>Neither you nor we will have the right to litigate any claim in court or have a jury trial on any claim. Further, you and we will not have the right to participate in a representative capacity or as a member of any class pertaining to any claim.
        <br><br>For this section, you and us includes any corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or related persons or entities. Claim means any current or future claims, dispute or controversy relating to your use of the Sites, these Terms of Service, or any agreement or relationship you have or had with us, except for the validity, enforceability or scope of the Arbitration provision. Claim includes but is not limited to: (1) initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims, and third-party claims; (2) claims based upon contract, tort, fraud, statute, regulation, common law and equity; (3) claims by or against any third party using or providing any product, service or benefit in connection with the Sites; and (4) claims that arise from or relate to (a) any use of the Sites, including any mobile application; (b) advertisements, promotions or statements related to any accounts, goods or services on or made available through the Sites, including any mobile application; (c) benefits, services, offers or promotions related to the BeanLogin application (including fee-based or free benefit programs, enrollment services and reward programs); (d) any purchases made through one or more of the Sites, including any mobile application; and (e) your application for any account.

        <b class="sub-menu-title">Arbitration Agreement</b>
        <hr>
        <p>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER, CLASS ACTION WAIVER, AND FORUM SELECTION CLAUSE.  
        <br><br>PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND IS PART OF YOUR CONTRACT WITH A&amp;I SOLUTIONS, INC. IT CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
        <br><br>Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes will be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court.  In the event any litigation should arise between you and A&amp;I SOLUTIONS, INC.  in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND A&amp;I SOLUTIONS, INC.  WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
        <br><br>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.; 
        <br><br>Severability.  If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
        <br><br>Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.  Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
        <br><br>Survival of Agreement.  This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with A&amp;I SOLUTIONS, INC.
        <br><br>Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or A&amp;I SOLUTIONS, INC.  may bring an individual action in small claims court. In addition, if you are a user outside of the United States, the dispute resolution provision in our privacy policy (if any), and not this arbitration provision, shall apply to any disputes related to privacy.
        <br><br>Emergency Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding this arbitration provision, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before such courts in order to maintain the status quo pending the arbitrator’s ruling, and hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.
        <br><br>Courts.  In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree that such claims shall be exclusively brought (unless such courts do not have personal jurisdiction in the dispute) in the courts located in Atlanta, Georgia. </p>

The arbitrator's award will be final and binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA; however, any party will have 30 days to appeal the award by notifying the arbitration organization and all parties in writing.
