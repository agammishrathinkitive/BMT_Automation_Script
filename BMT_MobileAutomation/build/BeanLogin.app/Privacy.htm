        <b class="sub-menu-title">Children Under 13</b>
        <hr>
        <p>The Site is intended for a general audience over the age of 13. Being such, A&amp;I SOLUTIONS, INC. does not knowingly collect, store or aggregate Personal and/or Non-personal information from children under the age of 13.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>
            <b>Registration Information:</b> When you create a BeanLogin account, you will be required to provide an email address that will be used as your login/username. In addition, when you create a BeanLogin account, we ask you to select a “Password”.  That Password is the basis for the encryption key used in protecting your Encrypted Sensitive Information (see below). This Password is not known to A&amp;I SOLUTIONS, INC.and is not stored in any digital form unless you explicitly ask to do so.  When you enable specific services, we may collect additional information that you knowingly provide.
            <br> <br><b>Billing information:</b> When you make a purchase, we will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including your name and billing address.  Other billing information necessary to complete the transaction, like your credit card information, will also be collected.
            <br> <br><b>Encrypted Sensitive Information:</b> In order to use the password vault and secure digital wallet, you will enter certain information into the App, that may include highly sensitive information like identity information, credit card information, app-specific passwords, receipts for online transactions and secure notes (“Encrypted Sensitive Information”).  Each customer account within BeanLogin has a unique account key. This unique account key along with the user’s password is used to encrypt “The Encrypted Sensitive Information”. The unique account key is further encrypted by a master key that is securely stored separately from the account key. All of this encryption is performed on the BeanLogin server side using AES-256 symmetric encryption algorithm and none of it is viewable by A&amp;I SOLUTIONS, INC. in unencrypted form.
            <br> <br><b>
